# My First CSS Mini-Project

## Introduction
Welcome to my first CSS mini-project! This project is inspired by the teachings of Dave Gray's [CSS Mini-Project for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwTs9NR3Du8) video. The goal of this project is to apply the fundamental concepts of CSS learned from the tutorial to create a visually appealing web page.

## Project Overview
In this project, I have implemented the following CSS concepts:
- CSS Reset
- Body element styles
- Navigation bar styles
- Heading styles
- List styles
- Hypertext link styles
- Display properties (block vs inline)
- Pseudo-classes (like `:last-child`)

## Tools and Resources
The following tools and resources were used in this project:
- Chrome Browser: For testing and debugging.
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code): As the code editor.
- Live Server VS Code Extension: To preview the web page in real-time.
- vscode-icons VS Code Extension: For visually distinguishing file types.
- Github Themes VS Code Extension: For a personalized editor theme.
- W3C CSS Validator: To ensure the CSS code meets the standards.
- Specificity Calculator: To calculate the specificity of CSS selectors.

## References
- MDN CSS: For CSS documentation and guidelines.
- Google Fonts: For web-safe fonts.
- Coolors Contrast Checker: To check the contrast ratio of colors.
- HTML Color Codes: For a wide range of color codes.

## Setup
To get started with this project, clone the repository and open the files in Visual Studio Code. Use the Live Server extension to view your changes in real-time.
